## Skills

### Shared Engineering Tools

For any InCred engineer — not team-specific.

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `code-explorer` | `/code-explorer` | Explores any InCred microservice from inside its directory. Produces `SERVICE-KB.md` (human-readable, 9 sections) and `.service-kb/index.json` (machine-readable). Uses GitNexus for AST analysis + targeted file reads. Self-improves after each run. |
| `kb-merge` | `/kb-merge` | Assembles a unified domain KB from all `index.json` files created by `/code-explorer`. Produces `api-registry.md`, `integrations.md` (cross-service impact table), `data-models.md`, `services.md`, and an HTML architecture overview. Never re-reads source code. |
| `claude-publish` | `/claude-publish` | Publishes local skill/agent edits to configured GitHub repos. Auto-detects changed files, shows diffs, waits for approval. Syncs to all repos in `publish-config.json` by default. |

### MM Story Skills (PM-facing)

For Money Movement PMs. All story work lives in one skill — `/mm-story`.

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `mm-story` | `/mm-story --help` | **All PM story work in one skill.** Create epics, add/edit stories, run checklist review, explain gap reports, submit to pipeline, revise from PR comments. Run `--help` for the full guide. |
| `mm-enrich` | `/mm-enrich` | Enriches the MM Knowledge Base from any source — Slack threads, emails, meeting notes, paste. Run `/mm-enrich --help` for routing guide (what goes to KB vs PRFAQ). |

**`mm-story` flags at a glance:**

```bash
/mm-story --help                               # full PM workflow guide
/mm-story                                      # create new epic
/mm-story --add   MM-Epic-5                    # add story to existing epic
/mm-story --edit  MM-Epic-5-Story-3A           # edit story (pre-pipeline only)
/mm-story --review   MM-Epic-5 MM-Epic-5-Story-3A   # checklist check, read-only
/mm-story --check-gap MM-Epic-5 MM-Epic-5-Story-3A  # explain GAP-REPORT.md
/mm-story --submit   MM-Epic-5 MM-Epic-5-Story-3A   # Phase 1 formal gate
/mm-story --revise   MM-Epic-5 MM-Epic-5-Story-3A   # update from PR comments
```

### MM Pipeline Skills (Developer / Tech Lead / QA)

For Money Movement engineers running the SDLC pipeline. Phases 2–8.

| Skill | Command | Phase | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------|--------------|
| `mm-blueprint` | `/mm-blueprint` | 2 | Generates `PLAN.md` on the feature branch (Section 1: PM scope, Section 2: technical changes, Section 3: QA scenarios). Reads KB and uses GitNexus. If story is incomplete, creates `GAP-REPORT.md` for PM to fix. |
| `mm-approve-plan` | `/mm-approve-plan --pm` or `--tech` | 2 | PM approves Section 1, Tech Lead approves Section 2. Posts formal GitHub PR review. Both must approve before Phase 3 unlocks. |
| `mm-tdd` | `/mm-tdd` | 3 & 4 | Phase 3 Red: failing tests from PLAN.md Section 3. Phase 4 Green: minimal code to pass them. Human approval before each commit. Generates `BUILD-EVIDENCE.md`. |
| `mm-ship` | `/mm-ship --qa / --runway / --prod` | 5–7 | Promotes through environments in order. Conflict check before every PR. `@mm-qa-gatekeeper` runs tests at each gate. Generates `QA-EVIDENCE.md`. |
| `mm-telemetry` | `/mm-telemetry` | 8 | Posts Slack success summary, updates HTML metrics dashboard, triggers re-index. |
| `mm-status` | `/mm-status` | All | Read-only pipeline inspector. Shows current phase, what's done, what's blocking, what to run next. |

## Self-Learning Skills

All skills follow the shared memory protocol (`claude/shared/memory-protocol.md`). Over time each skill learns:

- **User preferences** — which approval gates you always approve, which steps you always skip
- **Run efficiency** — which reads return nothing useful for your codebase
- **Self-improvement** — after 5 runs, proposes patches to reduce friction further

Memory is stored per-user, per-skill at `~/.claude/skills/[skill]/memory/`. Nothing is shared between users.

---

## After Installing

1. Restart Claude Code
2. Run `/reload-skills` to activate
3. Test: `/mm-story --help` (MM PMs) or `/code-explorer` (any engineer)

---

## Publishing Updates

Use `/claude-publish` to push local changes to GitHub:

```bash
/claude-publish                      # detect what changed, push to all repos
/claude-publish --skill mm-story     # publish specific skill
/claude-publish --all --dry-run      # preview without pushing
/claude-publish --repo org           # push to org repo only
```

Config at `~/.claude/publish-config.json`.
